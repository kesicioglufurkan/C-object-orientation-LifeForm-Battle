# C-object-orientation-LifeForm-Battle
Introduction
LifeForm Battle is a C program designed to simulate a battle between various creatures based on their characteristics and predefined interactions. The program reads data from a file ("Veri.txt") containing integers representing different creatures and their attributes. Each creature belongs to a specific category based on the range of integers it falls into, such as plants, insects, flies, and bugs.

The program implements object-oriented design principles, including memory management using heap memory for dynamic object allocation, and inheritance and abstract classes to model the relationship between different creatures. It follows the principles of modularity and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) for better code organization and maintainability.

Features

Object-oriented design using inheritance and abstract classes, with dynamic memory allocation for better memory management.
Modular structure following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), allowing easy maintenance and extensibility.
Simulates interactions between creatures based on predefined rules (e.g., which creature can eat another).
Provides visual feedback on the console, displaying the initial state and the winner of the battle.
Utilizes GitHub for version control, enabling collaborative development and code sharing.

Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the program using MinGW (gcc) compiler.
Ensure that the "Veri.txt" file containing creature data is in the same directory as the executable.
Run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions.
Sit back and watch as the creatures battle it out to determine the ultimate winner.
