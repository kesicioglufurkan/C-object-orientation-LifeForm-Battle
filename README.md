# C-object-orientation-LifeForm-Battle
Introduction

LifeForm Battle is a C program designed to simulate a battle between various creatures based on their characteristics and predefined interactions. The program reads data from a file ("Veri.txt") containing integers representing different creatures and their attributes. Each creature belongs to a specific category based on the range of integers it falls into, such as plants, insects, flies, and bugs.

The primary goal of the project is to improve object-oriented design analysis and pointer usage in C. It implements object-oriented design principles, including memory management using heap memory for dynamic object allocation, and inheritance and abstract classes to model the relationship between different creatures. The program follows the principles of modularity and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) for better code organization and maintainability.

Features

Object-Oriented Design: Uses inheritance and abstract classes, with dynamic memory allocation for better memory management.
Modular Structure: Follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), allowing easy maintenance and extensibility.
Creature Interactions: Simulates interactions between creatures based on predefined rules (e.g., which creature can eat another).
Visual Feedback: Displays the initial state and the winner of the battle on the console.
Version Control: Utilizes GitHub for version control, enabling collaborative development and code sharing.
Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the program using the MinGW (gcc) compiler.
Ensure that the "Veri.txt" file containing creature data is in the same directory as the executable.
Run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions.
Sit back and watch as the creatures battle it out to determine the ultimate winner.
